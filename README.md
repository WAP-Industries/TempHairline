## Notes
The `main.py` files in [`GameHelper`](files\GameHelper) and [`internal`](files\internal) and `passwords.py` were converted into executables using [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)  
  
The executables were not included in this repository for obvious security reasons  

The tokens and channel IDs for the bots have also been removed from source code
